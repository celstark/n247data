Or, have a look in _scipy_ and find the function for `sem` - your call.\n","\n","***For bonus points, label the bars not by 1, 2, 3, 4 but by 20-39, 40-59, 60-74, and 75-89 or by decade (20s, 30s, 40s, ... 80s).***\n","\n","Sample call and output:\n","\n","```\n","BarsByAge(data,'LDI')\n","```\n","![PS_Pandas2_fig1.png](https://github.com/celstark/n247data/raw/main/data/PS_Pandas2_fig1.png)\n","\n","2) Once that is going, in your main code, call upon this function 3 times to plot a 3-panel figure (i.e., use _plt.subplots()_) that has the RAVLT, LDI, and Recognition scores plotted.\n","\n","3) Write a function that will show a scatter-plot with the linear regression line.  For normal-credit this will not have to deal with subplots.  For bonus kudos, make it handle subplots.

You can use these to determine the linear (1st-order) fit and determine the y-values to plot.  Hint: when plotting the line, you don't need to plot the actual xmetric.  So, here, when plotting the line, we don't need to use Age, we could use some nice linearly-spaced vector (ahem) that spanned the range of Age. Hint2: If you do this, look to _pyplot_ to add the line rather than Pandas. \n","\n","For those of you doing the bonus version, you should be able to make a 2-panel plot like this:\n","\n","```\n","ScatterWithLine(data,'Age','LDI',axes[0])\n","ScatterWithLine(data,'Age','Recog',axes[1])\n","```\n","\n","![scatter1](https://github.com/celstark/n247data/raw/main/data/PS_Pandas2_fig3.png)\n","\n","\n","You'll bang into the fact that Pandas lets you specify an axis in the plotting calls while pyplot doesn't (but their axes have plotting calls)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cYQJ5mcQnU2f"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","\n","csvfname='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celstark/n247data/main/data/StarkData.csv'\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMvPyCEU0wSpGV5OLMAeQv5","name":"N247 PSet Pandas 2 - Plotting and grouping.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
