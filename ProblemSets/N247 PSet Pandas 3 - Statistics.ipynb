For the R-like approach, you can use [Statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/) and go very deep in to things.  Often, though, the tools baked into the [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#module-scipy.stats) library will give you what you need.\n","\n","1) Take that same dataset used in the prior two Pandas assignments and perform a set of independent-samples t-tests, comparing the youngest group (AgeGroup = 1) to the oldest group (AgeGroup = 4) on LDI, Recognition, and RAVLT metrics.  In the end, print a summary table that lists the metric, the degrees of freedom (total count of the two sets minus two), the t-value (formatted to two decimal places) and the p-value (formatted to four decimal places).  Thus, your code should produce:\n","\n","```\n","LDI t(45)=5.32, p=0.0000\n","Recog t(45)=1.76, p=0.0847\n","RAVLT t(45)=3.05, p=0.0038\n","```\n","Bonus points if you write a function to do the t-test and format the output that you call on 3x.\n","\n","2) Plot a histogram of all the RAVLT scores and you may notice this doesn't look particularly Gaussian (normal).  This starts to get you worried that the t-test you did above isn't valid (as t-tests assume normal distributions).  Now, in truth, you should determine whether each of your young and old groups looks normal (or use a built-in test for normality), but to assuage your concerns, you decide to run the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test on the young-vs-old RAVLT scores.  Run that test and report the results.\n","\n","Not just kudos, but kleos to anyone who automates a normality test and, when it flags an issue, runs the non-parametric test instead of the t-test. (Still produce the full output for #1 if you do this.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"v7EMeNTXzZcr"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy import stats\n","\n","# Reminder: the CSV file is 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celstark/n247data/main/StarkData.csv'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
