    "# How random are you?\n",
    "Just how good are people at generating random numbers?  We're going to try to find out here in this project. We're going to compare a series of user-generated random \"coin toss\" type events to actual coin toss events. In particular, we're going to see if people make random sequences or whether there's a bias embedded in there. We'll do this by looking at the distribution of run-lengths (how often do you have N in a row?).  For example, if 1=heads and 0=tails, the sequence `1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0` would have, for heads, 3 1-length runs, 2 2-length runs, and no 3-length runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the user input\n",
    "For the first part of this project, you'll collect a series of 1's and 0's from a user. There are fancier ways of doing this but, trust me, when tossing in cross-platform aspects, macOS security, and simplicity, we're going to just use the `input` method in Python. The downside to this is that it just asks you to enter in a string and waits until you hit Enter. There's no ability to filter the keys and no ability to make sure exactly N valid keys have been pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, *write a function that has the user ostensibly press a bunch of 1's or 0's. Then, take that input, remove anything other than 1 or 0. Do this using a list comprehension. You can keep it as a list or convert it back to a string.* Once that basic bit is done, *set it up so that it can take a `min` (default 20) number of 1's and 0's that must be in there and enforce this.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a string is something you can iterate over. Here, for example, taking `foo` and filtering out the numbers:\n"
