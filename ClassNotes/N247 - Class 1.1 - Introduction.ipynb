Some host machine (e.g., Google Colab) has a version of Python running and when you ran the cell, it \"defined a function\" called *approximate_size()*, and then called that function twice.

So, all that is part of the function\n","*   Python knows that the `def approximate_size(...` through the `raise ValueError...` all are part of one block and that the `print` starts something else because of the indentation (other languages use \"end\" statements, squiggly brackets, etc).\n","*   Note the colon here though at the end of the `def` line - that's basically saying an indent is coming - it's another block of code we're going into.

What values? Whatever is in _SUFFIXES_.\n","\n","Well, whatever is in a part - a slice of _SUFFIXES_ - the 1000 or 1024 index of it\n","\n","So, let's say we have _multiple_=1000. The first time, the result is 'KB'.  The next will be 'MB', etc.\n","\n","Let's say _size_ = 1,000,000 (1 million).  \n","\n","\n","\n","*   The first time in the loop we hit that `/=` sign (aka `size = size / multiple`), _size_ is now 1,000\n","*   if-statement -- is 1000 &lt; 1000? Nope\n","*   Loop back to the start\n","*   _suffix_ is now 'MB'\n","*   _size_ goes to be 1\n","*   is 1 &lt; 1000?  Yup\n","*   returns this goofy thing\n","\n","What does return mean? Returns - jumps out of this function we're doing here. So we bail on the loop and anything after that and we return a value - in this case that string.\n","\n","Now, we've got a lot of odd stuff in there - It's a string formatter - we'll get to it later, but:\n","\n","\n","\n","*   `0` and `1` are placeholders - the 0th and 1st things that format will spit out - size and suffix\n","*   The `.1f` thing - means floating-point number with one decimal place.  For example, try running this in a scratch cell: `'{0:.1f} {1}'.format(1.2341, 'duckies')`\n","*   But for the moment, forget all this fancy formatting ... we'll come back to it later.  Just know there's a lot you can do.\n","\n","**raise statement**\n","```\n","    raise ValueError('number too large')\n","```\n","What if things go wrong?  Well, here in the code, if we've gotten past that loop and haven't returned some nice ouput, things have gone badly. It's good practice to have your code let other code know that some kind of problem exists.  Here, we're going to send out a big alert (called an exception).  There are multiple kinds of exceptions - here it's a problem with a value - _ValueError_.  The idea is that your code that might call this function may be able to handle the error gracefully - \"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that\".\n","\n","We'll get to try ... except bits later.  But the idea is it's just a way to let anyone else know - any other bit of code know - that the sticky brown stuff hit the rotating blades.\n","\n","\n","## Change from the book\n","The book has an if-statement here and puts the print statments inside that if-statement:\n","```\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    print(approximate_size(1000000000000, False))\n","    print(approximate_size(1000000000000))\n","```\n","\n","**_TL;DR: This is your \"when I run this file, do this\" section_**\n","\n","Every time I've taught this course, this trips people up and so I changed his code.  There are deep reasons why he did this, but they apply a lot less to us and less still when using things like Jupyter notebook environments.\n","\n","\n","## One more thing\n","\n","Clear your current Python machine by going to *Runtime, Restart runtime* (or close this window and open it again).

But, at this point, Python doesn't know about it - it's a clean, virgin copy of Python we're running.  We need to tell it - we need to let it read these statements like the `def` bits to learn this - to add it in - to create that function.  We've not done anything to execute or load our code.  Python has never read over those lines and executed them, so that new function hasn't been learned by this clean copy of Python.\n","\n","Now, fix this by hitting the _Run cell_ icon on the code and verify that your scratch cell works again."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SnSfpx7OD-NV"},"source":["\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
