    "You're going to have to generate a lot of random numbers in the course and it's a great way to simulate data. Later on, you'll be doing a lot of random shuffling for things like permutation analyses, so it's best we lay the framework here.  When using numpy, the first thing you need to do is to create a random number generator.  For the vast majority of what you'll do, you can use their default generator:\n",

That's where the notion of a _random number seed_ comes in. When you create a random number generator, you can pass in the _seed_. With the same seed, you'll create the same random sequence.  The sequence is random in that, without knowing anything else, you can't predict the next one. But, if you know the seed, you can. This can be very handy.\n",

In particular, the `scipy.stats` module has very handy functions for distributions. Want to know the probability density function or cumulative sum for distributions you've never heard of?  `scipy.stats` [is your friend](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) (Note, it's got a lot more than this - plenty of statistical tests in there!). \n",

Things like `.pdf` and `.cdf` for the probability density function (what's the height of this distribution at point x?) and cumulative distribution function (what's the sum of the distribution at point x?) along with `.mean`, `.median`, `.std`, etc. are all in there. But we also have `.rvs` to generate a random sample from that distribution.\n",
